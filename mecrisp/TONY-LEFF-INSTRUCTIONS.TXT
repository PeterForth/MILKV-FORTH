Peter Forth has asked me to explain what I have done, to get Forth running 
on my Milk V Duo 256....
So, step 1, create an image of the official Linux for the Milk V Duo, as explained 
on the Milk V website.
Step 2, insert sd into the Milk V, and insert the Milk V, into the expansion board, 
then hook up to a terminal using serial port.
Step 3, connect an ethernet cable to the expansion board, and your router.  
 Ping the router @ 192.168.42.1 to ensure connectivity.
Also, plugged in a wifi dongle, into one of the usb ports, 
then edited WPA_Supllicant file in /etc directory, to include my SSID & Password. 
 Then Reboot.
Step 4, on my laptop (connected to the Milk V via serial port), 
visited  https://sourceforge.net/projects/mecrisp/files/ 
and copied this link, then switched to my terminal connected to the Milk V,
 
and typed in wget https://sourceforge.net/.../mecrisp-quintus-1.1.0.tar.gz
this downloaded Mecrisp Quintus into the Milk V, in the current directory.  
 I then gunzip'd the file, then tar'd the file...
finally, I had a look through the directory structure and found that
 the files in the linux-rv64 will execute with 
 ./mecrisp-quintus-linux-rv64imc
